This is easy. By default the stfp-server of a Raspberry Pi is located at: /usr/lib/sftp-server, so we need to get WinSCP to execute it with sudo.

Go to your WinSCP profile (Session > Sites > Site Manager)
Click on Edit > Advanced... > Environment > SFTP
Insert sudo su -c /usr/lib/sftp-server at "SFTP Server"
Save and connect
